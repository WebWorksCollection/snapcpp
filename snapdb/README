Important parts of Cassandra that we are using:

 * Load balancing by having X nodes running and sending further requests
   to a node that is not currently overwhelmed

 * Replication capability having data sent to several nodes for "backup"
   and also faster retrieval (i.e. data can be retrieved from any computer
   that has a copy, not just the original)

 * Simple database with (1) context [keyspace], (2) tables, (3) rows,
   (4) columns, and (5) values. Nothing more.

 * "Only columns are sorted." (rows are sorted, but using their MD5 sum
   so it is generally not viewed as a useful sort.) We created indexes
   using those columns.

   * However, in most cases the fact that columns are sorted is not
     important; we could look into having three "types" of data added
     to a row:

     1. sorted rows so one can create an index (the way to sort should
        also be a  function--sort by number, ASCII, locale, time, where
        would a "null" go, etc. [can we have a column representing null
	in the first place?! not at this time])

     2. blob of X number of fields (something similar to what Cassandra
        first offered where we transfer the whole blob with all the fields
        in one go instead of many small fields which take forever,
        especially when the connection is encrypted) -- this should be
        100% transparent to the end user except for the fact that we need
        be able to tell which field can be in the blob and which cannot be
        (unless the system decides automatically using the size of the value)
        the "X" number could be managed by the system so once we reach a
        certain number, the system automatically breaks blobs in pieces
	(if I'm correct, this is what CQL offers with there CREATE TABLE
	since you may now create any number of "columns"; however, supported
	a full fledge set of column names that would possibly be symetrical
	in all rows is not what we want at all.)

     3. regular fields that are "not sorted" (it still needs to be sorted
        but does not need to be an exact sort like (1) implies.)

 * Consistency: the use of various types of consistencies (ONE, QUORUM,
   ALL are those we use. We should also look into supporting LOCAL_...
   once for the local DC opposed to remote DCs) This means we have to
   read/write the data in at least ONE, at least QUORUM, or ALL replication
   nodes. This means communication between nodes to make sure we have the
   latest data (i.e. a write may have happened on node 3 and that means
   a read from node 7 needs the data on node 3 since node 7 was not yet
   updated.)

   (i.e. If your replication factor is 3 and you have 12 nodes, ALL means
   the data will be saved on 3 nodes before the database says it is done
   with it. It will never copy the data on the 12 nodes.)

   * Cassandra also offers a consistency of ZERO (write can fail) and
     a consistency of ANY (write can happen on any node, even if that's
     not a matching destination--i.e. token mismatch--although our own
     system would want to send the data to a matching node, if no such
     node is available, sending the data to a mismatched node would at
     least offer us a way to save that data in the database at some point.)

 * Gossip between nodes to maintain various information about the
   nodes (keep a list of existing and running nodes; would certainly
   be part of the load balancing work.)

 * Journaling, incoming data is first saved in a journal; this should allow
   us to save all the incoming data in a file used as a queue and once done
   with that queue, it gets deleted


What we use Cassandra for, but should not because these "activate"
anti-patterns:

 * Inter-front ends Lock capability. (We could implement this one in
   our proxy instead--because we lock Cassandra, but really it is used
   to just block all front ends but one while doing certain work.)

 * Queues for backend processes. (The list, for example, adds paths
   to the listref, or some such table, so the pagelist backend can
   work on those pages once it wakes up and it is decided that the
   data is ready.)

 * Local cache within libQtCassandra could be somehow replicated using
   our "proxy" front end server; this is send a "I have data from this
   timestamp" and the server can just say "you're good".


What the Cassandra cpp-driver offers that we would be using to ease
access to the cluster (i.e. this is not part of Cassandra servers):

 * Multi-backend connections, which is neat, but really it creates
   such connections in each child!!! This is not a good idea.


Somethings not offered by Cassandra:

 * "Proxy" server -- this is not currently true, that is, the driver
   itself is a standalone library but it should be relatively easy
   to have a proxy from that; the idea is that from the computer
   on which you run apps that have to access the Cluster, we need
   to have a proxy so that way we can have connections that are
   kept alive forever and a system that handles disconnect/reconnect
   automatically

 * Do permanent external backups (i.e. send a copy to another set of nodes
   that are there only to keep a copy of the data and not to participate
   in the cluster.)

 * "timed server"; Cassandra does not tell you whether the nodes and
   computers running the "Proxy server" are not synchronized time wise.
   This would be useful to make sure that the cluster works as expected
   over long period of time (i.e. if one clock drifts backward or fardward
   compare to the others, then it will possibly save data with the wrong
   timestamps if you do not run a proper timed service.)

 * Pre-compression on the client's node; depending on whether the network
   is super fast (i.e. no encryption between nodes) or slow (i.e. running
   with a VPN) we could ask the proxy to compress the data before sending
   it to the backend.
