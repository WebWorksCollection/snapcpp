A few things that still need to be done in this project:

  1. Remove required dependency on Cassandra, we should have a version
     that works without any database because these servers will anyway
     be capable of sending their data to each others.

  2. Implement all the network shit... listener, PING reply, data sharing

  3. Plugin for Snap! Websites to look at the data.
