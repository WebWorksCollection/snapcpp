Note: at this point we only support Linux. The library is likely to compile
      and work under other OSes though.

To generate csspp from its tarball, you need cmake and a C++ compiler,
then run the following commands:

   mkdir BUILD
   cd BUILD
   cmake ..
   make

The results will be under the "dist" directory. However, that is "installed"
meaning that it won't know how to find shared libraries. You may, however,
immediately test the binary "csspp/src/csspp".

The dist directory is otherwise ready to be installed under /usr.
