  * Added all the remaining expression tests.
  * Got the array and map to work as expected.
  * Added support for negative offsets (to get items from the end of the array.)

  * Properly check trigonometry parameters as these are expected to be angles.
  * In internal functions, broke up decimal number and percent in cases where
    both are not 1 to 1 equivalent.
  * Verify dimensions in several more internal functions (min/max/...).
  * Fixed the names of internal functions that included a '-' instead of an '_'.
  * Fixed many expressions so they would work as expected.
  * Fixed the output of an identifier with special characters.
  * Changed the set_hsl()/get_hsl() to use a radiant angle instead of degrees.
  * Removed the color::adjust_...() functions which are not used.
  * Fixed output of "-0" to be replaced by "0".
  * Fixed code so it would compile and run successfully in release mode.
  * Fixed the lexer integer part overflow test so it works in all cases.
  * Updated the node output so it can easily be checked in more cases.

csspp (1.0.3~trusty) trusty; urgency=high

  * Added a --no-logo command line option.
  * Allow comments to appear within { ... }, but still just by themselves
    (this allows for conditionally adding @preserve comments.)
  * Added BOOLEAN support as a unary expression.
  * Added "border-radius" as a "font metric" field since it uses '/' to
    separate vertical and horizontal lengths.
  * Fixed a compiler test tags which were completely incorrect.
  * Added a test to verify the --no-logo option.
  * Changed the '[hide]' tag with '[hidden]' because '[hide]' is a
    special catch tag which prevents such tests from being run by default.
  * Updated the pack script to verify versions.
  * Started test to verify the expression class.
