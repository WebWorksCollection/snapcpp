To be closer to what SASS supports, we shall implement the following
additional features:

. variable named when calling a function:

     $func($name: value, $arg2: value2, ...)


. Implement @extend

. Support the placeholder in the assembler

. Support for lists / maps in expressions

. Full coverage for expressions, also look into adding many still missing
  operations (i.e. color + color, color * 3, int * flt, etc.)

. Add !important in variables, preventing further definitions of that variable

      $var-final: 3px !important;

      $var-final: 15px;  <-- error, !important prevents redefinition
