  <description>
    <p>The snapfirewall daemon allows enforcing strong firewall
    rules from any computer in your cluster.</p>

    <p>It should be installed on all systems.</p>

    <p>Note that the firewall requires the snapdbproxy package
    since it makes use of the database to manage the list
    of IP addresses to block.</p>
