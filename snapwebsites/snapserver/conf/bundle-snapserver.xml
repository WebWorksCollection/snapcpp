  <description>
    <p>The snapserver daemons are expected to run on many backend
    computers. Often, for small organizations, snapserver is
    installed along the frontend. Note that if you use OpenVPN,
    you most certainly want to keep the frontend and server
    on the frontend computers to avoid an additional
    encryption/decryption along the way.</p>

    <p>The snapserver is the actual daemon that generates the HTML
    of your Snap! Websites.</p>
