# Often a Cassandra cluster will go bad and thus a repair will be
# necessary; this should be done after you isolated the node to
# be repaired... For the scrub command to work, you will have to
# stop the node and restart it. Without a restart, it is likely
# to not do what is necessary. Make sure to wait a little at the
# start to give Cassandra enough time to restart.
#
# Make sure nodetool is in your path (it should be with the default
# installation of Cassandra.)
#
# This command repairs the local node. To repair another node, either
# log in that computer or specify the host on the command line.

nodetool scrub snap_websites

#
# You may also want to run a repair; this requires the node to be
# back in the ring; it allows Cassandra to copy any missing data
# from the other nodes to the node you just repaired

#nodetool repair snap_websites
