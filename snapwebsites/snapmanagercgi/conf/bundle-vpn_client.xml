  <description>
    <p>The OpenVPN bundle is used to secure public connections
    between computers. If you have a secure LAN then you do not
    need to install OpenVPN at all. (i.e. a secure LAN is a LAN
    that only your computers have access to.)</p>

    <p>The OpenVPN creates a network of computers to communicate
    through a safe, encrypted tunnel (Server Side) rendering a
    public LAN secure.</p>

    <p>The OpenVPN client allows this computer to connect to
    OpenVPN servers to create a safe network. Once connected
    to one or more servers, the new client can also communicate
    with other clients (client-to-client).</p>

    For a client, the setup is simpler: we just need to have a few
