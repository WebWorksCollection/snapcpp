Description:
     Offer a default page to eventually make it easier to handle the
     snapmanager.cgi installation.

Documentation:
     This page defines how you must edit the snapmanager.conf file
     before you will be allowed to access the snapmanager.cgi page.
     By default the page is "403 Forbidden" until you do the correct
     edit to the snapmanager.conf.

     This page appears immediately after installing the snapmanager.cgi
     file. It will show up in your server. Just go to your server IP or
     domain name without any other information.

		<h2>Installation Success</h2>
		<p>It looks like Snap Manager CGI was installed properly since
		you see this Apache2 webpage.</p>
		<h2>Security (403 Forbidden&mdash;how to palliate)</h2>
		<p>For security reasons, we prevent access to snapmanager.cgi
		from all by default. To allow yourselves, edit the
		<code>/etc/snapwebsites/snapmanager.conf</code>
		file and put your IP address in the variable named
		<code>clients</code>. For example:</p>
		<blockquote>
			<pre>clients=192.168.0.3</pre>
		</blockquote>
		<p>If you have multiple administrators, enter the IP address
		of each one of them separated by commas, spaces are
		allowed:</p>
		<blockquote>
			<pre>clients=10.0.0.3,10.0.1.5, 10.0.3.11</pre>
		</blockquote>
		<p>We, on purpose, do not support a mask because only a very
		few computers should be used to manage your Snap! Websites
		cluster.</p>
		<h2>Administer</h2>
		<p>Now you should be ready to administer your
		<a href="http://snapwebsites.org/">Snap! Websites</a>
		cluster.</p>
		<p>Note that the <code>snapmanagercgi</code> package
		is only required on one computer unless you need to use
		OpenVPN, because until OpenVPN is properly installed, you
		do not want to have <code>snapcommunicator</code> communicate
		between various computers. You can install OpenVPN manually
		or with <code>snapmanager.cgi</code> if you install it on
		each one of your servers.</p>
		<p>To access the actual online snapmanager, go to the
		following address:</p>
		<blockquote>
			<pre><a href="/cgi-bin/snapmanager.cgi">http://&lt;your domain name or IP address&gt;/cgi-bin/snapmanager.cgi</a></pre>
		</blockquote>
