<h1>Snap Manager CGI</h1>
<p>It looks like Snap Manager CGI was installed properly. To access the
actual CGI, go to:</p>
<p>http://&lt;your domain name or IP address&gt;/cgi-bin/snapmanager.cgi</p>
<p>For security reasons we prevent access from all by default. To
allow yourselves, edit the <code>/etc/snapwebsites/snapmanager.conf</code>
file and edit the variable named <code>clients</code>.</p>
<blockquote>
<pre>
clients=192.168.0.3
</pre>
</blockquote>
<p>If you have multiple administrators, enter the IP address of each one
of them separated by commas.</p>
<blockquote>
<pre>
clients=10.0.0.3,10.0.1.5,10.0.3.11
</pre>
</blockquote>
<p>We, on purpose, do not support a mask because only a very computers
should be used to manage your Snap! cluster.</p>
