  <!--
    This is here mainly for completeness, but the log server is
    really not ready for a Snap! Websites cluster.

    We would also need either a snapinit .xml file for it or
    have a systemd .service file... (at least once it is cluster
    safe.)

    <p>If you want to send all your logs to a log server, then at least
    one of your computers should have this bundle installed.</p>

    <p>At this point this service is not cluster safe in the sense that
    there is not way to offer a fallback in case the server computer
    goes down. It is therefore not a recommended option.</p>
