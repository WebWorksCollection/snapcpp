OS Tests
========

These tests are used to show how we can do this or that on Linux.

These are not tests that run against our library and as such we
do not need to compile them all the time. The parent CMakeLists.txt
actually has this directory commented out by default.

These are kept here as "good" examples of what one can do to access
this or that resource.
