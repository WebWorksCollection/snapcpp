IP / Address related Tests
==========================

The tests defined in this folder will test objects related to IP or address
handling.


IP Test
=======

This test prints out the list of local addresses as returned by:

    addr::get_local_addresses();

It is not an automatic test in that it prints out the results which you
have to verify by hand.
