libsnapwebsites (1.2.5.0~xenial) xenial; urgency=high

  * EX-131: dropping the "list" table is not unlikely to timeout, we added
    a try/catch to ignore the problem since 99% of the time it won't be
    a problem at all (i.e. the table is dropped, the cluster is just a
    bit slow in letting us know and the client times out.)

    a special case for the "Link: ..." header.

libsnapwebsites (1.2.2.0~xenial) xenial; urgency=high

  * SNAP-529: actually found one case that would SEGV in snap_backend because
    the connection to cassandra gets cleared up and then we still try to
    access a table.
  * Also cancel the reconnect timer if we receive another CASSANDRAREADY
    message (no need to re-request, right?)

  * EX-185: Using the "sites" variable made me discover a couple of problems
    in snap_uri, there may still be one more that I have not yet caught.
    The problem was a variable that could be incremented twice in a row.
  * Started a test to verify that the snap_uri object works as expected.
  * Fixed the cell() function documentation in snap_expr.

libsnapwebsites (1.1.89.0~xenial) xenial; urgency=high

  * SNAP-529: Applied several fixes to avoid crashes when we lose a connection:
  * (1) reset backend/sites/context pointers with just .reset(), the
    destructors now know to safely clearCache() themselves.
  * (2) added a try/catch in the is_ready() function since it can end up
    throwing and we want to continue instead of "crashing".
  * (3) removed the hack in the child process of snapbackend, we do not need
    to keep the f_cassandra pointer of the parent around anymore.
  * (4) added a signal handler so if we receive a SIGPIPE we know about it.
  * (5) fixed the bio_deleter() to prevent BIO_free_all() from closing the
    socket and thus avoid the shutdown(), that wayt the connect can continue
    in the parent process. There is still a potential for a clash in
    multi-threaded pr multi-process application, though.
  * Added a note to the snap::process implementation and SIGPIPE.

libsnapwebsites (1.1.85.0~xenial) xenial; urgency=high

  * EX-167: Moved the implementation of the part_t class to the .cpp file.
  * Made the default and undefined level values constexpr functions.
  * Fixed the `<` operator so it sorts for largest to smallest.
  * Broke out the parsing code of the WeightedHttpString so we can call it
    multiple times cumulatively.
  * The parser also generate error messages now.
  * Moved the sorting of parts of the WeightedHttpString to the class.
  * Added a get_composed() so we can composed a locale without each time
    guessing whether a `_` or `-` is necessary.
  * In parsing the browser languages, avoid the copy of the resulting vector.
  * Added snap_child::get_all_locales() so one can check for a revision with
    any one language the user prefers, plus a few defaults: "en", "xx", "".
  * Fixed a loop that used `0` instead of `i` to access the data in the loop.
  * Finally added a catch test for the libsnapwebsite library. At this time
    this only includes a test for the WeightedHttpString object, but we are
    to grow that with any number of tests we can add. It will be easy to add
    more so we should not hesitate to do that as time passes.
  * Added some documentation.
  * Various clean ups.

libsnapwebsites (1.1.22.0~xenial) xenial; urgency=high

  * SNAP-355: To really broadcast to all computers, I have to set the
    service to "*". Setting just the server that way allows for broadcasting
    only if the service in not running locally.

libsnapwebsites (1.1.17.0~xenial) xenial; urgency=high

  * SNAP-378: Applied fix so the do_update() calls only happen when we use the

    background and thus way safer.
  * If current state not "ready," frontend users get a 503 error.
  * Removed access to the install_layout() call from frontend users.

 -- Alexis Wilke <alexis@m2osw.com>  Thu, 29 Sep 2016 21:52:47 -0700

  * SNAP-447: Applied a fix to the permanent connection. The background
    connection would not properly remove the thread signal from the
    snap communicator list of connections, so it could still be triggered
    after the permanent connection entry was long gone.
