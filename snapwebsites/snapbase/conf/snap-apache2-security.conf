# Snap! Websites default security setup
#
# This file is very much based on the security.conf file that comes with
# apache2, however, the default is not PCI compliant so we tweak them
# and enable our version instead of the default (the default is
# unmodified and remains disabled...)
#
# Please see the the original for more information:
#   /etc/apache2/conf-available/security.conf
#


# Remove obvious ways of giving away our version/environment
#
ServerSignature Off
ServerTokens ProductOnly


# Never allow trace mode
#
TraceEnable Off


# For some reasons, apache2.conf makes the whole /var/www/* indexable!
# Although we now remove the autoindex module, we always want the default
# reversed by default.
#
<Directory /var/www/>
  Options -Indexes
