  <description>
    <p>This bundle installs the snapbackup tool on a computer.
    In most cases you want to install this tool on a computer
    running Cassandra, especially if your network requires the
    OpenVPN to create a secure LAN. However, watch out for disk
    space if you save many backups on the same computer!</p>
    <p><strong>WARNING:</strong> By default the installation
    uses <code>127.0.0.1</code> as a Cassandra node IP address.
    If you are not installing snapbackup on a Cassandra node,
    then make sure to change that IP address or you will not
    get any backups. A field named backup / host will appear
    after installation.</p>
