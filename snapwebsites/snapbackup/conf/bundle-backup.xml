    <p>This bundle installs the snapbackup tool on a computer.
    In most cases you want to install this tool on a computer
    running Cassandra, especially if your network requires the
    OpenVPN to create a secure LAN. However, watch out for disk
    space if you save many backups on the same computer!</p>
