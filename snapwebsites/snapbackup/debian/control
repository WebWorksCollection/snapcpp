Description: Fast Websites: powerful CMS for Apache written in C++.
 Snap! C++ runs your CMS using binary code written in C and C++.
 The basic concept is taken from a large set of Drupal 6.x
 modules from Drupal Core and necessary 3rd party modules (we've been using
 over 220 modules on top of the Core modules.) The result is quite
 extensible as it offers a plug-in mechanism that everyone is welcome to use to
 create their own extensions.
 .
 This package contains the backup/restore utility that interfaces directly
 with a Cassandra database backend.
