/** \brief Handle one Fixed Box item.
 *
 * This class represents one Fixed Box item. A Fixed Box is defined as
 * a \<div> tag with class "fixed-box":
 *
 * \code
 *  <div class="fixed-box"
 *       fixed-box-name="ref"
 *       fixed-box-container="ref"
 *       fixed-box-orientation="vertical"
 *       fixed-box-margin="10">
 *    <div>This is the fixed content</div>
 *  </div>
 * \endcode
 *
 * If the height of the div.fixed-box may not be correct (i.e. a float
 * generally has the wrong height of 0px), then you can specify the
 * one div that will represent a valid height for this fixed-box in
 * the fixed-box-container attribute. The reference is a standard
 * CSS selector (it can be an identifier, a class, tag types, etc.)
 *
 * The name is used to give the user a way to retrieve a FixedBox
 * that was automatically initialized. Note that it is mandatory
 * even if you do not use it.
 *
 * The orientation defaults to "vertical" and also allows "horizontal".
 * If you scroll up/down, then the default is enough. If you scroll
 * left/right, then change the orientation to "horizontal".
 *
 * \note
 * A vertical fixed box only gets its "top" CSS field modified.
 * A horizontal fixed box only gets its "left" CSS field modified.
 *
 * The fixed box margin is used to make sure that the fixed box does not
 * get glued to the edge of the browser.
 *
 * A fixed box is usually created automatically when loading a page.
 * You may dynamically create fixed boxes if you'd like.
 *
 * \bug
 * If the boxes within a fixed box are somehow resized, then the
 * current position may be wrong. You may manually call the
 * adjustPosition() function if you know that the box changes
 * size.
 *
 * \todo
 * We need to add code to observe whether some of the widgets
 * concerned (container, this box, the child) change size. We
 * want to have a separate piece of code that does that observation
 * using the followgin code:
 * https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/MutationObserver
 * see also the stackoverflow reference here:
 * http://stackoverflow.com/questions/9628450/jquery-how-to-determine-if-a-div-changes-its-height-or-any-css-attribute/29568586#answer-29568586

 * which is expected to be fixed on the screen while the window gets
 * scrolled.

 * In most cases, it is a box on the left or the right of the page's
 * main contents. The entire setup of such boxes is done in HTML. This

 * go at position 0 on the page because there is most certainly a header
 * there. It also won't go to the bottom if there is a footer in the way.

 * Note that boxes that should never scroll, you should use a fixed
 * position instead of this capability.
