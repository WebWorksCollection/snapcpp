/** \brief User session timeout.
 *
 * This class initialize a timer that allows the client (browser) to
 * "close" the window on a session timeout. That way the user does
 * not start using his account when it is already timed out (especially
 * by starting to type new data and not being able to save it.)
 *
 * The timer can be set to display a warning to the end user. By default
 * it just resets the current page if it is public, otherwise it sends
 * the user to another public page such as the home page.
 *
 * \todo
 * Add a timer that goes and check the server once in a while to make
 * sure that the session is not killed in between. Like for instance
 * once every 4h or so. Only that check must be such that we avoid
 * updating the dates in the existing session.
