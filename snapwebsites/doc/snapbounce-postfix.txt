Our online documentation:

  http://snapwebsites.org/implementation/feature-requirements/email-feature-core/setting-postfix-snapbounce


1) Create a "snapbounce" user for executing the script

Note that the name of this user cannot be "root" or "postfix".
The account must have no shell and no login.

	useradd snapbounce


2) Edit:  /etc/postfix/main.cf

	# Additions to Postfix for snapbounce to work
	notify_classes = bounce
	bounce_notice_recipient = bounces@snapwebsites.org
	transport_maps = hash:/etc/postfix/transport.maps

* WARNING: if you already have the field "notify_classes", add "bounce"
           to it by separating existing flags with a comma

* Where "bounces@snapwebsites.org" has to correspond to your domain name.

* Just like "notify_classes", if you already have a "transport_maps",
  then you do not need to create a new one. You will want to edit
  that file and not "/etc/postfix/transport.maps" as indicated in step (3).


3) Create or Edit:  /etc/postfix/transport.maps

	# After changes to this file, run postmap:
	#   postmap /etc/postfix/transport.maps
	bounces@snapwebsites.org snapbounce:

* Where "bounces@snapwebsites.org" is the same as defined in
  bounce_notice_recipient in main.cf

* Make sure to run:   postmap /etc/postfix/transport.maps
  so the .db file is generated with your changes


4) Edit:  /etc/postfix/master.cf

We name the service "snapbounce". The same as what appears in the
/etc/postfix/transport.maps file. There is our changes:

	# service  type  private unpriv  chroot  wakeup  maxproc command + args
	#                (yes)   (yes)   (yes)   (never) (100)
	snapbounce unix  -       n       n       -       -       pipe
		flags=FRq user=snapbounce argv=/usr/bin/snapbounce --sender ${sender} --recipient ${recipient}

* The snapbounce tool is installed under /usr/bin when installing
  the package of the same name.


5) Verify:  /etc/snapwebsites/snapserver.conf

Make sure your snapserver configuration is in order. It must have the
Cassandra IP and port (will change once we have a Cassandra driver):

	# Host & Port to connect to Cassandra
	cassandra_host=10.0.0.2
	cassandra_port=9160


6) Make sure the Cassandra server is up and running.

	sudo service cassandra start


7) Restart postfix so the changes take effect.

	sudo service postfix restart
