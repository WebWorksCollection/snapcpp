  <name>frontend</name>
  <description>
    <p>The frontend bundle installs Apache2 and snap.cgi which together
    handle client requests and determine whether to proxy the request
    to a snapserver.</p>

    <p>It is expected to be installed only on frontend computers.</p>

    <p>You should not install this bundle on any of your backend
    computer. If you want to run snapmanager.cgi on a backend,
    it will not involve snap.cgi at all.</p>

    # installed when snapbase got installed, then this command did not
    # run, so run it now to make sure it is effective
