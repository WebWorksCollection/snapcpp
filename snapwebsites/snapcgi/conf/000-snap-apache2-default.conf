# The following is the default apache2 configuration coming with Snap!
# websites. If you use the bundle-frontend.xml file to install the
# apache2 server along with snap.cgi, then this file will be installed
# to handle all hits to that server.

# Regular site (port 80 is HTTP)
<VirtualHost *:80>
  # Name of the server
  ServerName snap.example.com
  # ServerAlias ...

  # We have to have a document root, preferably one that exists
  DocumentRoot /var/www/html/

  # Error and other logs
  ErrorLog /var/log/apache2/snap-default-error.log
  CustomLog /var/log/apache2/snap-default-access.log combined

  # Directory with snap.cgi -- update if you don't use the default
  #ScriptAlias /cgi-bin/ /usr/lib/cgi-bin/

  # Do not show directory contents
  Options -Indexes
  # ... other options ...

  # Uncomment the following to limit access to only one given IP address
