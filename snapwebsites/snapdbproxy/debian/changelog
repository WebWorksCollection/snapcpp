snapdbproxy (1.0.7.0~xenial) xenial; urgency=high

  * SNAP-110: The delay of the timer used to reconnect in case we lose the
    connection to snapdbproxy (or never got one from the start) was never
    set. I also added the code that increases that delay (doubling it) on
    each attempt from 1s to 5 min.
