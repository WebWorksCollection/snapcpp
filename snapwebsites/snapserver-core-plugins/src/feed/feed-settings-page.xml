      RSS 2.0 only accepts PNG, JPEG and GIF file formats
      that being said, we may want to support a script that
      resizes and changes the format and thus we accept more
      formats but really only send a PNG to the feed.
      The size constrained for RSS 2.0 are 144x400 maximum
      and we suspect around 16x16 minimum. The default
      expected size is 88x31.

      Atom 1.0 does not specify an image format, however, it
      does say images should be squares (WxH where W == H)
      for icons and 2x1 (WxH where W = H x 2) for logos;
      and overall that the size "should remain small".
