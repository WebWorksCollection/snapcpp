    <help>
      Drag &amp; Drop an image here or use the Browse button to define
      your favicon. A favicon image must be a square image. The small one
      appearing in the tab of your browser is a 16x16 image. Some browsers
      support larger images and different formats. However, this field
      is for the small version (16x16). Note that a .ico file may include
      images of various sizes. You may provide one .ico image with 16x16,
      32x32, 48x48, and 64x64 if you have such.
