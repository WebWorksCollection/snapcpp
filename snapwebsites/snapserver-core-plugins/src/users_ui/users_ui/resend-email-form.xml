    <tooltip>If you registered on our website and you did not receive a confirmation email, then you can use this form to request for a new email.</tooltip>
    <help>After registration, we require each user to verify their email address. If you properly entered your email address, then you will get a code that can be used to verify that you indeed own (or act as the owner of) that email address. However, if the email never makes it, you won't be able to verify your new account. This feature allows you to request a new email with the verification code so you can still complete your registration.</help>
