    </tooltip>
    <help>
      The detect ad blocker uses an AJAX command to inform the server on
      whether the client's browser is running an ad blocker or not. This
      allows the server to save the information attached to that end user
      and avoid sending further ads to the client if they already informed
      us that an ad blocker was active. This saves time and bandwidth on
      your server.

    <help>
      This parameter defines the number of days the server will stop
      sending adds to a client that has an ad blocker. The default is
      one day. The maximum is 366 which is also the maximum duration
      of a user session. Note that many times the cookie we send to
      users does not last very long anyway (unless the user comes back
      to the website over and over again.)
