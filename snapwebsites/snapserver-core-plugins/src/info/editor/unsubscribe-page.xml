        The unsubscription has two options:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          Disallow this website only: this option removes you from this
          very website, other websites run by this installation of Snap!
          Websites may continue to send you emails;
        </li>
        <li>
          Never email from any website: this option authorizes us to
          removes you completely, in this case we will not send you any
          emails at all unless you create an account with our systems,
          we will send you one email for verification purposes.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        At this time we do not give you the option to later change this
        choice. You will have to contact us to remove your email from
        our blacklist and thus start receiving emails again.
