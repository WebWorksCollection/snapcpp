    <help>
      In order to change this parameter, edit your snapserver.conf
      configuration file and edit the "plugins_path" parameter. When
      undefined, the system uses the default of
      "/usr/lib/snapwebsites/plugins". Unless you are working on Snap!
      as a developer, you should never have to change this path.
      Also as a developer, you may need to support more than one path.
      This variable actually supports multiple paths each separated by
      a colon. Plugins are search in each path and the first instance
      found is the one loaded.
