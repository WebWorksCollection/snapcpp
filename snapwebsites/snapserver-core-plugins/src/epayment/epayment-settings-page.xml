      Enter the name of your store.
      To make sure it fits on credit card statements,
      make sure to make it short (i.e. the maximum is about 20 characters).
    </tooltip>
    <help>
      Enter the official name of your store.
      This name is used to present your store to your customers on the website.
      It is also used in various other places such as credit card statements and emails.
      The name should be short enough to fix in all those places.
      Generally, the name should not be more than 20 characters.
      The hard limit for bank card is 22 characters, but often the name gets shrunk to just about 10.
      Here we allow you to enter up to 50 characters.
