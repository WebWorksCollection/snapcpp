    <help>
      In most cases, since you are going to use the Time Tracker for
      tracking staff hours, you probably want to use Monday or Thursday
      as the first day of the week. However, some people may find that
      offensive thinking that Sunday has to be the first day. This
      selection allows you to choose how to show the weeks to your users.

        The <strong>First Sunday</strong> is used by most of the Americas,
        South Africa, China, Japan, Israel. The first week may be given
        number 0 instead of 1, representing a first week starting in
        the previous year.
      </p>
      <p>
        ISO 8601 (<strong>First Thursday</strong>) is used by most of the
        European countries, most of Asian and Oceania. The first week may
        not start in the previous year.
      </p>
      <p>
        The <strong>First Monday</strong> represents the day of the first
        week in the new year.
      </p>
      <p>
        Unfortunately, strftime() does not currently support a first week
        day starting on a Friday so we do not support Islamic weeks properly.
        This is used throughout the Middle East.
