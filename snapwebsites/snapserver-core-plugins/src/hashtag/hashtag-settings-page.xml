    <help>A hashtag can be shown as a link with the hash character in front of it (like twitter.)
          It can be shown as a standard link, in other words we can remove the hash character.
          The word can be made a hidden link, which means the word looks like the other words
          although if clicked, it still sends the user to the hashtag.
          Finally, the word can be plain normal and the link added at the bottom of the page.</help>
