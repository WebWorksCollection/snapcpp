# The clamav was defined here before, which means it would get installed on
# all computers that had the plugins when really it is only necessary on the
# one computer running the CRON snapbackend processes; see the antivirus
# bundle for more details; we suggest it in case a programmer installs the
# package on his machine without using bundles...

Description: Fast Websites: powerful CMS for Apache written in C++.
 Snap! C++ runs your CMS using binary code written in C and C++.
 The basic concept is taken from a large set of Drupal 6.x
 modules from Drupal Core and necessary 3rd party modules (we've been using
 over 220 modules on top of the Core modules.) The result is quite
 extensible as it offers a plug-in mechanism that everyone is welcome to
 use to create their own extensions.
 .
 This package contains required core plugins for the snapserver daemon.
 .
 html2text required for sendmail.
 clamav required for antivirus.
 libqrencode3 required for qrcode.
