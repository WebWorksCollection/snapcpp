The snapcommunicator reads files with the .service exntesion that are
defined in this directory as names of services that will connect to it
over time (as they get started.)

This is the complete list which is sent to the remote snapcommunicator
instances.

The files here are created by the postinst script of packages that
offer a service or services and removed by the postrm script. These
files are not expected to be created by hand, unless you are a
programmer running various tests.
