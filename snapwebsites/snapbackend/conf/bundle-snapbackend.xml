  <description>
    <p>The snapbackend daemons are expected to run on one or more backend
    computers. These daemons handle database management to make the
    front end faster (i.e. that way front ends just have to gather
    pre-computed data.)</p>

    <p>Which backends run on which computer can be selected from the
    various service and timer files. You may reserve one whole computer
    to just run the pagelist backend, for instance.</p>

    <p>This package depends on the snapserver-core-plugins. Backends that
    you develop can depend on your own plugins as well.</p>
