# turn on with (note: it is on by default):

# Secure site (port 443 is HTTPS)

# We do not turn this one on by default, although you should use HTTPS
# for obvious security reasons... This is because we do not know anything
# of your SSL certificate and the setup of such varies depending on your
# SSL provider.
