Description:
     Offer a default page to eventually make it easier to handle the
     snapmanager.cgi installation.

Documentation:
     This page defines how you must edit the snapmanager.conf and
     the snapcommunicator.conf files before you will be allowed to
     access a valid snapmanager.cgi page.

     By default the page is "403 Forbidden" until you do the correct
     edit to the snapmanager.conf.

     By default the my_address variable is set to a "random" IP address
     which is not likely the IP address of your computer. We do not
     want to automate this one because it needs to use a secure
     private network and some computers have public IP addresses,
     private address which are not secure, and private addresses
     that are secure. Our installation script could not easily decide
     which one to use. You want to use the private secure one, obviously.

     This page appears immediately after installing the snapmanagercgi
     package. It will show up in your server. Just go to your server IP or
     domain name without any other information. If you already had Apache2
     installed with other parameters, then you may need to also edit the
     snapmanager-apache2.conf file and change the ServerName parameter
     to your domain or may it appear first in the direct so it is taken
     as the default by Apache2.

		<h2>Installation Success</h2>

		<p>It looks like Snap Manager CGI was installed properly since
		you see this Apache2 webpage.</p>

		<h2>Manual Administration</h2>

			<h3>Security: Snap Manager CGI (403 Forbidden&mdash;how to fix)</h3>
				<p>For security reasons, we prevent access to
				<code>snapmanager.cgi</code> from all by default.
				The installation script should ask you to enter
				a list of IP addresses separated by commas. If
				you made a mistake, or did not include yourself,
				then you will get a <strong>403 Forbidden</strong>
				error.</p>

				<p>To allow yourself, edit the
				<code>/etc/snapwebsites/snapwebsites.d/snapmanager.conf</code>
				file and put your IP address which your browser
				connects <i>from</i> into the variable named
				<code>clients</code>. Do not put in the IP address
				which the webserver runs on, unless that is also
				a desktop system with a browser which will access
				the frontend machine (i.e. you are testing on your
				own development machine.)</p>
				<p>For example:</p>
				<blockquote>
					<pre>clients=192.168.0.3</pre>
				</blockquote>
				<p>If you have multiple administrators, enter the IP address
				of each one of them separated by commas, spaces are
				allowed:</p>
				<blockquote>
					<pre>clients=10.0.0.3,10.0.1.5, 10.0.3.11</pre>
				</blockquote>
				<p>We, on purpose, do not support a mask because only a very
				few computers should be used to manage your Snap! Websites
				cluster.</p>
				<p class="notes"><strong>Note:</strong> It is not recommended that you edit the
				<code>/etc/snapwebsites/snapmanager.conf</code> file.
				Please only make changes in the
				<code>/etc/snapwebsites/snapwebsites.d/snapmanager.conf</code>
				file. In fact, this is recommended for any
				<strong>Snap!</strong> service in general (<u>.conf</u> files).</em></p>

			<h3>Server Name</h3>
				<p>It is recommended that you set the <code>server_name</code> variable in
				<code>/etc/snapwebsites/snapwebsites.d/snapcommunicator.conf</code> if you
				want full control of the computer name. By default the hostname of the
				server is used, but that hostname may not always be what you want
				Snap! to use.</p>
				<p>For example:</p>
				<blockquote>
					<pre>server_name=frontend1</pre>
				</blockquote>
				<p>This may be required if your computer hostname is not
				compatible with the Snap! environment. (includes characters
				other than a-z, 0-9, and underscores, or starts with a digit.
				Note that snapinit knows to change '-' characters into
				'_', although that may generate other problems.)</p>

			<h3>Apache Conflict: The fight between Snap Manager CGI &amp; Snap CGI</h3>
				<p>Although it is possible (we have done it) to
				run both, <code>snapmanager.cgi</code> and
				<code>snap.cgi</code> with the exact same apache
				<code>VirtualHost</code> entry, we use two separate
				configuration files to make sure that one does not
				conflict with the other (i.e. you may want to
				add directives to the <code>snapmanager.cgi</code>
				that should not apply to <code>snap.cgi</code>
				and vice versa.)</p>
				<p>However, the fact that we offer two files
				with two distinct <code>VirtualHost</code> means
				that Apache2 will not see the <code>snapmanager.cgi</code>
				settings once both are installed unless you make sure to
				define its <code>ServerName</code> parameter first.</p>
				<p>So... once you access your <code>snapmanager.cgi</code>
				server the first time, we suggest you first
				look for the <code>snapmanager::server_name</code>
				and enter a name there. For example, you may
				want to give it the same name as your computer hostname.
				Maybe it is <code>snapmanager</code>, <code>snap1</code>, or
				<code>cassandra3</code>. If you plan to install a DNS, you
				will also be able to give a sub-domain name to each computer.
				That can be a lot easier in the long run (i.e. maybe something
				like: <code>snap1.snap.website</code>.</p>
				<p>But until then, edit your administrator's computer
				<code>/etc/hosts</code> file and place the
				information in there as in:</p>
				<blockquote>
					<pre>192.168.55.31    snapmanager</pre>
				</blockquote>
				<p class="notes"><strong>Note:</strong> please enter <u>your</u>
				private network IP address instead of the one shown in the
				example.</p>
				<p>Now you can access your <code>snapmanager.cgi</code>
				by entering <code>http://snapmanager/</code>
				in your browser location bar. This means you
				are ready to install the <code>frontend</code>
				bundle.</p>

		<h2>Browser Administration</h2>
			<p>Now you should be ready to administer your
			<a href="http://snapwebsites.org/">Snap! Websites</a>
			cluster.</p>
			<p>Note that some day the <code>snapmanagercgi</code> package
			will be required on just one computer. However, at this time
			many of the manager features do not work right across computers
			so really you will want to install <code>snapmanagercgi</code>
			on all the computers in your cluster.</p>
			<p>Now, to access the actual online snapmanager, go to the
			following address:</p>
			<blockquote>
				<pre><a href="/snapmanager">http://&lt;your domain name or IP address&gt;/snapmanager</a></pre>
			</blockquote>
