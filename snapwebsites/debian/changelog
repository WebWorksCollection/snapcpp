snapwebsites (1.5.26.0~xenial) xenial; urgency=high

  * Fixed test websites: the canonical is not enough, we need to prevent
    search engines from indexing such sites by telling them NOINDEX.
  * Fixed reference to snapwebsites.org with HTTPS.
  * Fixed the tag name: X-Robots-Tag -- we were missing "-Tag".

snapwebsites (1.5.25.0~xenial) xenial; urgency=high

 -- Alexis Wilke <alexis@m2osw.com>  Mon, 14 Aug 2017 21:57:06 -0700

snapwebsites (1.5.21.0~xenial) xenial; urgency=high

snapwebsites (1.5.16.0~xenial) xenial; urgency=high

  * The fix to the root user permissions actually exposed another bug: the
    updating of the cache could end up using an empty version of the list
    of permissions when we shortcut the calculation of the permissions to
    know whether the user is allowed (i.e. the default list is the empty
    list and we would save that even if we did not call the function used
    to generate the list of permissions of a page.)

snapwebsites (1.5.9.0~xenial) xenial; urgency=high

  * EX-79: Found out that if a page supports more than one image, then we must
    have a field name and not use "image" as that name. We may have a problem
    with the body which does not offer a separate field name for each image...

    directory.
  * Updated some manager-plugins to use the new `widget_select` for drop
    downs.

  * SNAP-222: Checking whether a file was properly added required to test
    with the correct path and not whether a file is attached to the field
    (because on Save we get a string, not the file which was already sent
    to use using AJAX.)

 -- Alexis Wilke <alexis@m2osw.com>  Thu, 29 Jun 2017 11:49:42 -0700

snapwebsites (1.5.2.0~xenial) xenial; urgency=high

  * SNAP-579: Split snaplistd/snaplog into a new bundle: mysql. These bundles
    both rely on the mysql bundle to be installed. And both bundles will
    manage their respective users and tables, removing them when purged.
