* Compile, Build, Install

This project uses cmake to generate the Makefile necessary to build the
project:

   tar xf snapmanagercgi-1.0.0.tar.gz
   mkdir build
   cd build
   cmake -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=<where_you_want_it_to_go> ../snapmanagercgi-1.0.0
   make
   [sudo] make install

This should work on all Unices. We have not yet worked on the project to
get it to function under MS-Windows.
