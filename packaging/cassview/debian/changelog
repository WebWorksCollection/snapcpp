cassview (0.0.4-1) saucy; urgency=high

  * Proper versioning, plus nice about dialog and icons.
  * Added a flag for display vs edit, so that way large blobs don't take a
  long time to load.

cassview (0.0.3-1) saucy; urgency=high

  * Modified the RowModel to be a table-based model (but not item-based, so no parent nodes).
  * Has two columns: name and value. Name is read-only, value is editable.
  * View has changed to a table view, and the columns automatically adjust when the model is reset (reloaded).
