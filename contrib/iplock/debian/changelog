iplock (3.0.0.0~xenial) xenial; urgency=high

  * SNAP-355: Refactor the tool so we can use --block even if the IP is
    already in the list.
  * --unblock was changed to --remove.
  * A --count option was added.
  * Added support for --scheme so we can block other things than just HTTP.
  * The chain and a counter were added so one can use -I and various schemes.
  * Moved the configuration data under /etc/iplock and support the
    /etc/iplock/iplock.d for user modified versions.
