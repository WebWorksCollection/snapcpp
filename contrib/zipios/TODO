A few things that contributors can definitively help with:

 * Update the contrib/zipios++.spec.in so it works with 2.0.
 * Help with getting the project to work under MS-Windows.
 * Implement a ZipExtra class to handle the extra buffer.
 * Implement a VirtualEntry to allow in-memory files.
 * Add a test for the cmake/FindZipIos.cmake code.
