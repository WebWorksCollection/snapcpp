Description: Parse command line arguments, environment vars and configs.
 Provides the advgetopt::getopt class, which parses command line options (from
 argc/argv). It is very advanced and is capable to read many different
 types of options with a letter (-h) and a word (–verbose) with no parameters,
 one parameter, any number of parameters, and a set of "filenames." Also,
 entries can be read from the command line, the environment and/or a config
 file.
