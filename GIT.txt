# check what you've changed (verify that you want to commit all of those)
git diff ["<filename>"]

# check files that have changed, the status

# After a git pull ... you may have a conflict (you should see that in the
# output of git); first edit the file and search for <<<, >>>, or === and
# correct the code as required; then do a commit on that filename, after
# that you should be all fine.
