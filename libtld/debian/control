Description: C/C++ library used to verify domain names by extracting their TLD
 A URL is composed of a protocol, a domain name, a path, a query string, and
 an anchor. The query string and anchor are optional. The protocol is most
 often very easy to verify. The domain name, however, can be very complicated
 if you need to know of the sub-domains, the very domain name itself, and the
 TLD. The libtld helps you with pointing out where the TLD starts in the
 domain name. That way you can extract the sub-domains, the domain name itself
 and the TLD for any world-wide URI. Note that this is very important if you
 manage cookies in a browser.
