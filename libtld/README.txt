Notes:

  o Version 1.4.17 includes even more new global TLD entries.
  
  o "Intermediate" versions are "lost" to our nightly build server.

  o Version 1.4.6 includes many (most) of the new allowed global TLD entries.
    (INA expects about 960 new TLDs within the next few years.)

  o Version 1.4.3, 1.4.4, and 1.4.5 are missing because these were used to
    finish up the Debian installer. Although one version included a memory
    leak but I did not then find the time to upload a new version here.

  o The .deb versions for Ubuntu can be downloaded from our snapcpp PPA
    on launchpad:

      https://code.launchpad.net/~snapcpp/+archive/ppa/+packages

  o The PHP extension was not downloaded in the previous version, so I
    won't upload a new version here. It did not change anyway.
