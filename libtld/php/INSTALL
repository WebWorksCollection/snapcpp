In order to get the PHP plugin to work you need the php5-dev environment.
Then run the build script.

The installation will go to your php5 .so directory automatically.

Next you need to edit your .ini files and include this:

extension=php_libtld.so

You will have to restart Apache2 if you want that to run there. Something
like this:

service apache2 restart

(reload won't do it)

Then you can start using the libtld library from PHP with the following:

$a = check_tld('www.m2osw.com');
var_dump($a);

The result is either FALSE or an array with the different fields as found in
the info structure:

array(5) {
  ["result"]=>
  int(0)
  ["category"]=>
  int(0)
  ["status"]=>
  int(0)
  ["offset"]=>
  int(9)
  ["tld"]=>
  string(4) ".com"
}

If it worked, then $a['result'] == 0 and $a['status'] == 0. Before checking
$a as an array, do this:

  if ($a === FALSE) ... handle error ...

You may consider including the check_tld.php file to get result, category,
and status definitions.
