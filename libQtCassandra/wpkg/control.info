DESCRIPTION=C++ library to access Cassandra using Qt 4.8+.
 libQtCassandra is a library that wraps the interface offered by Cassandra
 via thrift. If you have a look at the code offered by thrift, you may
 understand why I needed to have a wrapper. Also, I wanted a way to manage
 the Cassandra resource without having to know what I have to allocate and
 free. The library is RAII as required.

 This is the main binary package, also called the runtime package.
Description/development: ${V:DESCRIPTION}
 This is the development package, useful to compile and link against the
 libQtCassandra library.
