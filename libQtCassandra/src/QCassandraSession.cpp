/** \class QCassandraSession
 * \brief Creates and maintains a CQL session with the Cassandra server
 *
 * This class handles such things as the connection to the Cassandra
 * server and hiding all of the cassandra-cpp library interface.
 *
 * The interface does not seem to manage lifetimes of objects it creates,
 * so we put in many smart pointers with customer deleters to make sure
 * that object are returned to the free store upon destruction.
 *
 * Also, this class, in conjuction with QCassandraQuery, provide a set of fa√ßades
 * to hide and encapuslate the details of the cassandra-cpp driver. This allows
 * us to use the CQL interface seemlessly, but without having to worry about
 * object lifetimes and garbage collection.
