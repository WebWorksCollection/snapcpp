/** \class QCassandraLock
 * \brief Lock mechanism using only Cassandra.
 *
 * So... You're super happy, you just found Cassandra and started using it to
 * rewrite your app. You slowly notice that there are things that you can
 * do with Cassandra at lightning speed, no way in 1,000 years would you want
 * to change from this concept to any other concept. But...
 *
 * All the read and write in Cassandra are individual commands. Cassandra
 * itself does not offer any way to synchronize a read or a write from all
 * the running hosts. What can you do?
 *
 * The need arise, in most cases, when your application has to create a unique
 * row. For example, you have a registration form where a user can enter a
 * username. That name must be unique throughout the entire database. When
 * that happens, the Cassandra system does not help you. You need to lock that
 * table (or at least that row) before you can create that unique row.
 *
 * This is where the QCassandraLock object comes in. It will lock an object
 * so a single process will have access to it for a while (until the lock
 * goes out of scope or is deleted.)
 *
 * The usage is expected to be something like this:
 *
 * \code
 *   //... ready to create the new user in the database ...
 *   {
 *      QCassandraLock lock(context, "user_table");
 *      if(users->exists(username))
 *      {
 *          // problem
 *          throw std::runtime_error("sorry, a user with that name exists");
 *          // Note: the lock destructor takes care of unlocking
 *      }
 *      users->row(username)->cell("email")->setValue(email);
 *      // Note: the lock destructor takes care of unlocking
 *   }
 * \endcode
 *
 * By default the lock is for 60 seconds and it is given 5 seconds to hold.
 * You may change these values by using an RAII class as this safe_timeout
 * implementation:
 *
 * \code
 *   void my_class::lock_database(lock_name)
 *   {
 *      class safe_timeout
 *      {
 *      public:
 *          safe_timeout(QtCassandra::QCassandraContext::pointer_t context)
 *              : f_context(context)
 *              , f_old_timeout(context->lockTimeout())
 *              , f_old_ttl(context->lockTtl())
 *          {
 *              // as short as possible
 *              f_context->setLockTimeout(1);       // decrease wait to 1 second (minimum)
 *              f_context->setLockTtl(4 * 60 * 60); // increase duration to 4 hours
 *          }
 *
 *          ~safe_timeout()
 *          {
 *              f_context->setLockTimeout(f_old_timeout);
 *              f_context->setLockTtl(f_old_ttl);
 *          }
 *
 *      private:
 *          QtCassandra::QCassandraContext::pointer_t   f_context;
 *          int                                         f_old_timeout;
 *          int                                         f_old_ttl;
 *      };
 *      safe_timeout st(f_context);
 *
 *      // we use a special name for the backend to avoid clashes with
 *      // standard plugin locks
 *      //
 *      return f_lock.lock(lock_name);
 *  }
 * \endcode
 *
 * The lock is implemented using the Cassandra database system itself
 * with the help of the Leslie Lamport's bakery algorithm (1974). You can
 * find detailed explanation of the code on Wikipedia:
 *
 *   http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lamport's_bakery_algorithm
 *
 * More details are found in the French version, somehow:
 *
 *   http://fr.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lamport's_bakery_algorithm
 *
 * A Cassandra version is proposed on the following page:
 *
 *   http://wiki.apache.org/cassandra/Locking
 *
 * The bakery algorithm is based on the basic idea that a large number
 * of customers go to the store to buy bread. In order to make sure
 * they all are served in the order they come in, they are given a ticket
 * with a number. The ticket numbers increase by one for each new customer.
 * The person with the smallest ticket number is served next. Once served,
 * the ticket is destroyed. The ticket numbers can restart at one whenever
 * the queue of customers goes empty.
 *
 * On a computer without any synchronization mechanism available (our case)
 * two customers may enter the bakery simultaneously (especially since we're
 * working with processes that may run on different computers.) This means
 * two customers may end up with the exact same ticket number and there are
 * no real means to avoid that problem. However, each customer is also
 * assigned two unique numbers on creation: its host number and its process
 * number. These two numbers are used to further order processes.
 *
 * So, the basic bakery algorithm looks like this in C++. This algorithm
 * expects memory to be guarded (shared or "volatile"; always visible by
 * all threads.)
 *
 * \code
 *     // declaration and initial values of global variables
 *     namespace {
 *         int num_threads = 100;
 *         std::vector<controlled_vars::fbool_t> entering;
 *         std::vector<controlled_vars::zuint32_t> tickets;
 *     }
 *
 *     // initialize the vectors
 *     void init()
 *     {
 *         entering.reserve(num_threads);
 *         tickets.reserve(num_threads);
 *     }
 *
 *     // i is the thread number
 *     void lock(int i)
 *     {
 *         // get the next ticket
 *         entering[i] = true;
 *         int my_ticket(0);
 *         for(int j(0); j < num_threads; ++j)
 *         {
 *             if(ticket[k] > my_ticket)
 *             {
 *                 my_ticket = ticket[k];
 *             }
 *         }
 *         ++my_ticket; // add 1, we want the next ticket
 *         entering[i] = false;
 *
 *         for(int j(0); j < num_threads; ++j)
 *         {
 *             // wait until thread j receives its ticket number
 *             while(entering[j])
 *             {
 *                 sleep();
 *             }
 *
 *             // there are several cases:
 *             //
 *             // (1) tickets that are 0 are not assigned so we can just go
 *             //     through
 *             //
 *             // (2) smaller tickets win over us (have a higher priority,)
 *             //     so if there is another thread with a smaller ticket
 *             //     sleep a little and try again; that ticket must go to
 *             //     zero to let us through that guard
 *             //
 *             // (3) if tickets are equal, compare the thread numbers and
 *             //     like the tickets, the smallest thread wins
 *             //
 *             while(ticket[j] != 0 && (ticket[j] < ticket[i] || (ticket[j] == ticket[i] && j < i))
 *             {
 *                 sleep();
 *             }
 *         }
 *     }
 *     
 *     // i is the thread number
 *     void unlock(int i)
 *     {
 *         // release our ticket
 *         ticket[i] = 0;
 *     }
 *   
 *     void SomeThread(int i)
 *     {
 *         while(true)
 *         {
 *             [...]
 *             // non-critical section...
 *             lock(i);
 *             // The critical section code goes here...
 *             unlock(i);
 *             // non-critical section...
 *             [...]
 *         }
 *     }
 * \endcode
 *
 * The algorithm requires one important set of information: a list of
 * host numbers from 1 to n. Without that list, the algorithm cannot
 * function. Therefore, before you can use the QCassandraLock object
 * you must add each one of your hosts to the Cassandra lock table in
 * a row named "hosts". You need to list at least all the hosts that
 * are to use this lock functionality; other hosts are not required.
 * Hosts that cannot find themselves in that list generate an
 * exception when trying to use a lock.
 *
 * Adding hosts to the database is a one time call per host to the
 * QCassandraContext::add_lock_host() function. \b WARNING: the
 * add_lock_host() function cannot be called by more than one
 * host at a time, in general, you'll use the snap_add_host command
 * line tool to add your hosts and it should be run on a single
 * computer at a time.
 *
 * Now, to apply that algorithm to a Cassandra cluster, you want several
 * small modifications. Our algorithm is 100% based on the bakery
 * algorithm, however, it makes use of fully dynamic vectors for the
 * entering and the tickets variables. These are replaced by columns in
 * a row of the host lock table. We offer a way to lock any kind of
 * object by give the user of the lock a way to indicate what needs to
 * be locked by name. For example, if you're creating a new row and it
 * needs to be unique throughout all your Cassandra host, the object to
 * lock is that new row, so you can use the key of that new row as the
 * name of the lock. In the sample code below we use object_name for
 * that information. This means we can use a different vector for each
 * lock!
 *
 * \code
 *      // lock "object_name"
 *      void lock(QString object_name)
 *      {
 *          // note: somehow object_name gets attached to this object
 *          QString locks = context->lockTableName();
 *          QString hosts_key = context->lockHostsKey();
 *          QString host_name = context->lockHostName();
 *          int host = table[locks][hosts_key][host_name];
 *          pid_t pid = getpid();
 *
 *          // get the next available ticket
 *          table[locks]["entering::" + object_name][host + "/" + pid] = true;
 *          int my_ticket(0);
 *          QCassandraCells tickets(table[locks]["tickets::" + object_name]);
 *          foreach(tickets as t)
 *          {
 *              // we assume that t.name is the column name
 *              // and t.value is its value
 *              if(t.value > my_ticket)
 *              {
 *                  my_ticket = t.value;
 *              }
 *          }
 *          ++my_ticket; // add 1, since we want the next ticket
 *          to_unlock = my_ticket + "/" + host + "/" + pid;
 *          table[locks]["tickets::" + object_name][my_ticket + "/" + host + "/" + pid] = 1;
 *          // not entering anymore, by deleting the cell we also release the row
 *          // once all the processes are done with that object_name
 *          table[locks]["entering::" + object_name].dropCell(host + "/" + pid);
 *   
 *          // here we wait on all the other processes still entering at this
 *          // point; if entering more or less at the same time we cannot
 *          // guarantee that their ticket number will be larger, it may instead
 *          // be equal; however, anyone entering later will always have a larger
 *          // ticket number so we won't have to wait for them they will have to wait
 *          // on us instead; note that we load the list of "entering" once;
 *          // then we just check whether the column still exists; it is enough
 *          QCassandraCells entering(table[locks]["entering::" + object_name]);
 *          foreach(entering as e)
 *          {
 *              while(table[locks]["entering::" + object_name].exists(e))
 *              {
 *                  sleep();
 *              }
 *          }
 *
 *          // now check whether any other process was there before us, if
 *          // so sleep a bit and try again; in our case we only need to check
 *          // for the processes registered for that one lock and not all the
 *          // processes (which could be 1 million on a large system!);
 *          // like with the entering vector we really only need to read the
 *          // list of tickets once and then check when they get deleted
 *          // (unfortunately we can only do a poll on this one too...);
 *          // we exit the foreach() loop once our ticket is proved to be the
 *          // smallest or no more tickets needs to be checked; when ticket
 *          // numbers are equal, then we use our host numbers, the smaller
 *          // is picked; when host numbers are equal (two processes on the
 *          // same host fighting for the lock), then we use the processes
 *          // pid since these are unique on a system, again the smallest wins.
 *          tickets = table[locks]["tickets::" + object_name];
 *          foreach(tickets as t)
 *          {
 *              // do we have the smallest ticket?
 *              // note: the t.ticket,  t.host and t.pid come from the column key
 *              if(t.ticket > my_ticket
 *              || (t.ticket == my_ticket && t.host > host)
 *              || (t.ticket == my_ticket && t.host == host && t.pid >= pid))
 *              {
 *                  // do not wait on larger tickets, just ignore them
 *                  continue;
 *              }
 *              // not smaller, wait for the ticket to go away

 *              {
 *                  sleep();
 *              }
 *              // that ticket was released, we may have priority now
 *              // check the next ticket
 *          }
 *      }
 *      
 *      // unlock "object_name" (as saved in this object)
 *      void unlock()
 *      {
 *          // release our ticket
 *          QString locks = context->lockTableName();
 *          table[locks]["tickets::" + object_name].dropCell(to_unlock);
 *      }
 *      
 *      // sample process
 *      void SomeProcess(QString object_name)
 *      {
 *          while(true)
 *          {
 *              [...]
 *              // non-critical section...
 *              lock(object_name);
 *              // The critical section code goes here...
 *              unlock(object_name);
 *              // non-critical section...
 *              [...]
 *          }
 *      }
 * \endcode
 *
 * \b VERY \b IMPORTANT: all database accesses must be done with at
 * least QUORUM if you have multiple centers and want to lock between
 * all centers then the Network Quorum must be used. The ALL is also
 * another option. Only if you want to lock local processes can you
 * use ONE, assuming that all those processes attach themselves to
 * the same Cassandra server.
 *
 * Note that the name of the lock table can be changed in your context
 * if done early enough (i.e. before any lock is ever created by that
 * process.) By default it is set to "libQtCassandraLockTable". See the
 * QCassandraContext::set_lock_table_name() function for details.
 *
 * Locks are created to lock any resource that you want to lock. It
 * does not even have to be Cassandra data. Just resources that need to
 * be accessed by at most one process at a time.
 *
 * The name of the object (\p object_name) represents the resource to
 * be locked. This can be anything you want. For example, to lock a
 * row in a table, we suggest the name of the table followed by the
 * name of the row, eventually using a separator such as "::". This
 * lock works even for rows that do not yet exist since the lock itself
 * doesn't need the row to lock it.
 *
 * \code
 *     // Note: Since "table_name" cannot include a ":" this is always
 *     //       a unique object name!
 *     object_name = table_name + "::" + row_name;
 * \endcode
 *
 * For example, you have a user registering on your website and you
 * request that user to enter a username. That username becomes the row
 * key in your users table. Say the user enters "snap" for his username,
 * then following our example the object name would be: "users::snap".
 *
 * The lock is attempted for a limited amount of time as specified in
 * the context with the QCassandraContext::set_lock_timeout().
 *
 * \note
 * It is possible to lock as many resources as you want. However, it is
 * very likely that you will run in lockup problems if you attempt to
 * lock more than one resource at a time from multiple processes. Instead,
 * think about the problem and create one higher level lock that locks
 * everything you need at once. That way you completely avoid lockups in
 * your applications.
 *
 * \warning
 * Althoug this class allows you to lock multiple processes, it is NOT
 * thread safe. If you are using multiple threads in your application,
 * then you should create one thread that locks and unlocks process
 * resources.
 *
 * \bug
 * If something goes wrong, as in a read or a write fails, the system
 * throws and tries to remove the lock. When a lock times out (takes
 * too long to lock the resource,) it may be because a process died
 * without unlocking the given resource. This also means that the lock
 * table now includes information that will actually not be deleted
 * until it times out (because of its TTL.) Obviously that means all the
 * other processes will timeout until that TTL kicks in. Finally, there
 * isn't a really safe way to clean up such a mess. More or less, what
 * this means is that the entire process better never fail (which is why
 * you want "many" nodes and a QUORUM is pretty much always attainable.)
 * This being said, we use a short TTL on all the data because a process
 * should never take that long to handle its resource. That TTL is a
 * guarantee that resources get released even if the resource owner does
 * not properly release it (because of a bad crash, the host gets
 * interrupted, the Internet connections are not cooperative...) Obviously
 * you will always be able to connect to your cluster with cassandra-cli and
 * delete the offensive lock data if required.
 *
 * \warning
 * The main failure mechanism requires your C++ compiler to make use of
 * proper RAII all the way. In Linux this often means that you need to
 * have a try/catch somewhere like in your main() function. Without that,
 * the unlock() function may not be called blocking all the other
 * processes until the TTL kicks in.

/** \var QCassandraLock::f_context

/** \var QCassandraLock::f_table
 * \brief Pointer to the lock table.
 *
 * On creation of a lock object, it calls its parent context to request

 * first lock may actually take a very long time to obtain. To make sure
 * it always works, you should have an initialization process in your
 * application such that a lock table is created before your full

 *
 * The test cassandra_lock can currently be used for that purpose. A

 * the locking processes.
 *
 * The name is used by the unlock() to remove the lock, it is then cleared.
 */

/** \var QCassandraLock::f_ticket_id
 * \brief The ticket of the lock.
 *
 * When a call to lock() succeeds, the lock created a ticket and this is

 * Whether the lock is currently in effect (true) or not (false).
 *
 * The lock() function sets this value to true when the lock succeeds.
 *
 * The unlock() function sets this value to false once the lock was
 * released.
 *
 * The lock constructors set this flag to false by default. If you
 * specify the name of the object to lock in the constructor, then
 * the lock() is called so in effect it will look like the constructor
 * sets the variable to true.

 *
 * \exception std::runtime_error
 * This exception is raised if the lock cannot be obtained after
