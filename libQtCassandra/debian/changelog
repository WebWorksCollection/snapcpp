  * Bumped copyright notice to 2016.
  * Fixed the qcassandra-lock top comment which was from the lock test.
  * Finally took care of the debian/copyright file.
  * Changed the README.txt to a README.md file instead.

libqtcassandra (0.4.7) unstable; urgency=medium

  * added support for a Cassandra-only Lock mechanism
  * Added many missing updates to this README.txt file.
  * Fixed some documentation.
  * Added support for specifying the consistency on a value
    read by setting the consistency in the cell.
  * Added a synchronization function so we can wait and have all the
    nodes running with the same schema version.
  * Fixed the QCassandra::Snitch() so it returns the snitch, not the
    protocol version.
  * Added a test to verify that locks work when processes run on any
    number of clients.
  * Updated the tests to properly work in a cluster environment.
  * Added a unit test for the QCassandraValue class which checks
    a large number of cases, this allowed me to apply fixes.
  * The <, <=, >, >= QCassandraValue operators were invalid.
  * Added Bool support in the QCassandraValue object.
  * Added an index to the QCassandraValue data; and a size
    for strings and binaries (although a UTF-8 size...)
  * Moved the read of values to global functions so they are
    accessible from other functions without having to use
    QCassandraValue variables
  * Fixed the findContext() so it loads the Cassandra contexts first
    if not yet loaded.
  * Fixed the disconnect() function so it clears all the variables
    and the same Cassandra object can safely be reused.
  * Fixed the QCassandraPrivate::getColumnSlice() and
    QCassandraPrivate::getRowSlices() functions which would not
    first transform the column key in a QByteArray and thus binary
    keys with null characters would invariably fail.
  * Fixed the QCassandraRow::dropCell() as it would emit a read of
    the cell before actually dropping it. The read would retrive the
    consistency value and/or the timestamp. These values are retrieved
    from memory only now, if defined.
  * Fixed the CMakeLists.txt so the thrift library is linked against
    the libQtCassandra library itself; that way it is not required in
    the binaries that link against the libQtCassandra library.
  * Removed all references to the boost_system library.
  * Reviewed the SSL connection capability. It is still not considered
    to be working but the password can now be specified from your
    application.
  * Included 2013 in copyright notices.

 -- Alexis Wilke <alexis@m2osw.com>  Sun, 27 Jan 2013 19:28:52 -0800

libqtcassandra (0.4.6) unstable; urgency=medium

  * Added support for UUID and char */wchar_t *.
  * Added direct support for QUuid as row and column keys.
  * Added direct support for char * and wchar_t * so we do not
    have to first cast strings to QString everywhere.
  * Fixed bug testing row key size to limit of 64535 instead
    of 65535.
  * Added a test as row and column keys cannot be empty. It will
    now throw an error immediately if so.
  * Updated some documentation accordingly and with enhancements.

 -- Alexis Wilke <alexis@m2osw.com>  Thu, 06 Dec 2012 19:28:52 -0800

libqtcassandra (0.4.5) unstable; urgency=medium

  * Added a first_char and last_char variables (QChar) in column predicate
    which can be used to define "[nearly] All column names".
  * Fixed the names of two functions: setFinishColumnName() and
    setFinishColumnKey() are now setEndColumnName() and setEndColumnKey()
    respectively (as documented and so it matches the getters.)
  * Added support for indexes defined with columns. The column predicate
    now has a setIndex() function and that allows you to call readCells()
    repititively until all the columns matching the predicate were returned
    (very similar to reading a large set of rows.)
  * Fixed a few things in the documentation.

 -- Alexis Wilke <alexis@m2osw.com>  Thu, 22 Nov 2012 19:28:52 -0800

libqtcassandra (0.4.4) unstable; urgency=medium

  * Added support for composite columns. It was functional before but
    with knowledge on how to build the column key which is actually
    quite complicated (okay, not that hard, but libQtCassandra is here
    to hide that sort of thing!) Use the compositeCell() function of
    your QCassandraRow objects.

 -- Alexis Wilke <alexis@m2osw.com>  Fri, 31 Aug 2012 19:28:52 -0800

libqtcassandra (0.4.3) unstable; urgency=medium

  * Added support for counters
  * Fixed several usage of keys so 0 bytes works as expected
    (in getValue() and insertValue().)
  * Small fixes to documentation.

 -- Alexis Wilke <alexis@m2osw.com>  Thu, 30 Aug 2012 19:28:52 -0800

libqtcassandra (0.4.2) unstable; urgency=medium

  * Primarily fixes the problem with readRows() which could not
    be used to read more than count rows because the following
    call would return an invalid set of entries.
  * Fixed readRows()
  * Fixed replicateOnWrite()
  * Fixed CMakeLists.txt in regard to thrift
  * Fixed prepareContextDefinition()
  * Added support for 1.0 and 1.1
  * Added the million_rows stress test
  * Upgraded to thrift 0.8.0

 -- Alexis Wilke <alexis@m2osw.com>  Wed, 22 Aug 2012 19:28:52 -0800

libqtcassandra (0.4.1) unstable; urgency=medium

  * Fixed the size of the buffer used to save 64 bit integers.
  * Fixed the size of integers used to handle floating points.
  * Fixed the double being read as 8 bytes and somehow converted to a
    float instead of a double.
  * Fixed the test of the string set in a value to limit the UTF-8 version
    of the string to 64Mb (instead of the number of UCS-2 characters held
    by a QString.)
  * Enhanced documentation about the findRow() and findCell() which do not
    look for a row or cell in the Cassandra system, it only checks in memory!
  * Better support older versions of g++ (4.1 cannot properly cast the
    controlled variables for enumerations) -- thank you to John Griswold
    for reporting the problem.
  * Added some missing documentation.

 -- Alexis Wilke <alexis@m2osw.com>  Wed, 16 May 2012 19:28:52 -0800

libqtcassandra (0.4.0) unstable; urgency=medium

  * Enhanced the cmake scripts to make it even easier (find/use Qt, Thrift)
    and thus I jumped to version 0.4.0 because this is a pretty major change
    from 0.3.x
  * Removed the Qt sub-folder names from \#include.
  * Made the getValue() function return false so we can know when it fails
    and react accordingly.
  * Fixed the use of the slice predicate and ignore the strings null
    terminator as they ought to be (i.e. a key can include a nul character.)
  * Added some try/catch to avoid a certain number of fairly legal
    exceptions (i.e. missing value or column.)
  * Removed all unwanted files from source package using a CPACK option.
  * Strip folder name from documentation to make it smaller.
  * Updated all copyrights to include 2012.

 -- Alexis Wilke <alexis@m2osw.com>  Sat, 12 May 2012 19:28:52 -0800

libqtcassandra (0.3.2) unstable; urgency=medium

  * Fixed the creation of a row predicate as it wasn't defining a column
    predicate which is necessary when we call readRows() with the default
    parameters on a table.

 -- Alexis Wilke <alexis@m2osw.com>  Fri, 07 Jan 2012 19:28:52 -0800

 -- Alexis Wilke <alexis@m2osw.com>  Sat, 26 Nov 2011 19:28:52 -0800

libqtcassandra (0.3.0) unstable; urgency=medium

  * Added a dropContext() in the QCassandra object.
  * Added proper unparenting of the context and table classes.
  * Started to make use of the Controlled Variables (requires 1.3.0 or better.)

 -- Alexis Wilke <alexis@m2osw.com>  Fri, 11 Nov 2011 19:28:52 -0800
